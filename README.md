# DiscordEmoteMilker
A simple discord bot, with utilities for easy export of custom emotes from any server!
## Setup
How to run it yourself?
1. Clone the repo
2. Refer to [Discord Net](https://discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html) to set up stuff on Discord Developer Portal
3. In the `Bot` menu you should enable `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`, if you won't do that the bot will be unable to see text message content
4. The proper permission integer in the OAuth2 url should be: `137439316992`
  - This integer is generated by giving bot the following permissions: Read Messages/View Channels, Send Messages, Attach Files, Read Message History, Use External Emojis, Use External Stickers
  - Probably not all of these are needed, but I might research that at the later time
  - The permission integer is included in the Discord OAuth2 link, with which you can authorize bot on your server:
  - `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your app id>&permissions=<your permissions integer>&scope=bot%20applications.commands`
5. Invite Bot to your server
6. Build code and run the bot app
7. Use commands to export the emotes!
